# sonos-detail-display

# Pre-requisites
1. You must have set up the [node-sonos-http](https://github.com/jishi/node-sonos-http-api) API, this must be set up internally on the same network that your SONOS System is. *However, it is possible to use dynamic dns (and port-forwarding) to allow this to work externally.* (This is not necessary, however). A [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) is perfect for this!
2. You need to edit the url for the api endpoint in the *"sonosConnect.js"* file. This can be an literal IP address, or a local hostname (don't forget the port!)
